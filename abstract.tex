\begin{abstract}
Ethereum has demonstrated the immense potential offered by trustless computing. However, organizational adoption of general purpose public blockchains such as Ethereum for transaction settlement has been hindered by issues of scalability and privacy. Centrifuge implements a hybrid on-chain/off-chain private by design protocol, with a focus on moving the financial supply chain towards a trustless and cryptographically secured protocol.
